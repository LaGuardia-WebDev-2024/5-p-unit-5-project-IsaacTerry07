        <span class= "first-sentence">Something about Nicki is she is the most versatile female rapper if not rapper in general.
        </span>
   <span     class= "Pop" >
        She has done it all, Pop, Pop Rap, EDM Rap, Rock Rap, RNB Rap the list can go on! But we are going to look a one of my <i>Favorite</i> song at the moment is called "Fallin 4 U". This song is the 5th track on her 5th Studio album called "Pink Friday 2", this songs speaks about how she is falling for someone and how they are special. But she is also the Braggadocious a phrase starting with "Picture that", and goes into detail on her impact!

        "Told him shoot his shot like his main opp (main opp)
Now I'm falling for him like a raindrop (raindrop)
D-d-d-d-done that, run that
Yo, Patty, give me the gun back
When he say "cock it back", gun off safety
Thinking 'bout you lately, JoJo and K-Ci
I be on that calm flex, them gyal hasty
Gyal, them want me face, but them gyal them can't face me
I-I ain't really tryna let him in-in (in-in)
But if he's a G, it's a win-win (win-win)
Can't play the queen before the king-king (king-king)
*****, I'm the Pinkprint, tell him to kiss the pink ring
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm-, I think I'm-, I think I'm fallin' for you)
They like 'em, they fighting, they coming, they tugging
I kill 'em, I beat 'em, I see them, they ducking
Got pit-bulls, we feed 'em, it's nothing
They never been official, they never been the issue
Plus they know that my body tea, my middle initial
I let him kiss the real, he know my looks could kill
These ****** gotta shake they *** to show sex appeal
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you
Picture that, picture me giving ****** slack (slack)
Picture pretending and give all these ****** piggyback (back)
Picture using me and the Barbz and never giving back (back)
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black (black)
Ain't at the mall but between me and them, it's a gap (gap)
Picture saying that you the queen and knowing it's a fact (fact)
Picture my head giving wet and wavy, strawberry daq' (daq')
Yo, matter of fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me opening the vault, *****, I seal that
Picture them disses sticking like grits, ****** feel that
Picture me telling ****** catch it, outer field that
Picture me not telling my lil' ****** drill that
Picture you ending up under the seat, where the dread at?
Picture not listening when I said that you would dread that
I mean <span class=latto> latto </span>, you-you's a chop ***
I'm number one, y'all go argue over top four
Clean, sweep, you getting mopped, ho
Picture me dressed in black, they calling me Miss Mary Mack (Mary Mack)
You get the picture, my ****** airing that
Li-like married to the mob, bitch, I'm married to the MAC (to the MAC)
Picture in, now getting scary, it's airy, where the MACs?
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm-, I think I'm-, I think I'm fallin' for you)
Ayo, you gotta catch me while I care, I ain't calling for you
Watching my every move, thought I was fallin' for you?"
